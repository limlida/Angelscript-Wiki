### FPhysicsAssetSolverSettings


Solver iterations settings for use by RigidBody AnimNode (RBAN) in the Anim Graph. Each RBAN node runs its own solver with these settings.

@note These settings have no effect when the Physics Asset is used in a world simulation (i.e., as a ragdoll on a SkeletalMeshComponent).

**属性**:

- `float32 CullDistance [RBAN: The distance at which collisions are ignored. In general you need this to be a bit larger than the typical relative body
movement in your simulation, but small enough so that we don't have to speculatively create too many unused collisions.]`
- `float32 FixedTimeStep [RBAN: The recommended fixed timestep for the RBAN solver. Set to 0 to run with variable timestep (default).
NOTE: If this value is non-zero and less than the current frame time, the simulation will step multiple times
which increases the cost.]`
- `float32 MaxDepenetrationVelocity [RBAN: When bodies are penetrating, this is the maximum velocity delta that can be applied in one frame.]`
- `int PositionIterations [RBAN: The number of position iterations to run. The position solve is responsible for depenetration.
Increasing this will improve simulation stability, but increase the cost.]`
- `int ProjectionIterations [RBAN: The number of projection iterations to run. The projection phase is a final pass over the constraints, applying
a semi-physical correction to any joint errors remaining after the position and velocity solves. It can be
very helpful to stabilize joint chains, but can cause issues with collision response. The projection magnitude
can be controlled per-constraint in the constraint settings (assuming ProjectionIteration is not zero).
This should be left as 1 in almost all cases.]`
- `int VelocityIterations [RBAN: The number of velocity iterations to run. The velocity solve is responsible for restitution (bounce) and friction.
This should usually be 1, but could be 0 if you don't care about friction and restitution.]`
- `bool bUseLinearJointSolver [RBAN: Whether to use the linear or non-linear solver for RBAN Joints. The linear solver is significantly cheaper than
the non-linear solver when you are running multiple iterations, but is more likely to suffer from jitter.
In general you should try to use the linear solver and increase the PositionIterations to improve stability if
possible, only using the non-linear solver as a last resort.]`
- `bool bUseManifolds [RBAN: It enables the use of multi-point contact manifolds, which are created only once at the start of each tick.
When disabled, a single-point contact is generated in each solver iteration which is more expensive.]`
