### FProjectBuildSettings


**属性**:

- `FString BuildCookRunParams [The commandline for BuildCookRun UAT command. Some substitutions are allowed:
  {Project} - Replaced with the path to the project's .uproject file
  {Platform} - Replaced with the platform name this is run for
  {inivalue:Config:Section:Key} - Replaced with the value for Key in Config's Section. Ex: -archivedirectory={inivalue:Engine:CustomSettings:OverrideArchiveDir}
  {iniif:Token:Config:Section:Key} - Replaced with Token if the vlaue for Key in Config's Section evaluates to True. Ex: {iniif:-iostore:/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings:bUseIoStore}
Because ProjectPackagingSettings is a common section to read, if Config:Section: are not specified for 'iniif' or 'inivalue', it will use the ProjectPackagingSettings settings:
  {iniif:-iostore:bUseIoStore}
Additionally, the ini settings can have an optional search and replace modifier, to easily modify the string. The Replace can be blank:
  {inivalue:BuildConfiguration|PPBC_=} - This will get the BuildConfiguration from the settings, and then remove the PPBC_ enum prefix from the string, to just get say Development

Adding -device={DeviceId} will show the command per-device in the platforms menu]`
- `FString HelpText [Any help that you would like to include in the ToolTip of the menu option (or shown in interactive mode Turnkey)]`
- `FString Name [The name for this custom build. It will be shown in menus for selection.]`
- `TArray<FString> SpecificPlatforms [If this build step is specific to one or more platforms, add them here by name (note: use Windows, not Win64)]`


**方法**:

- `FProjectBuildSettings& opAssign(FProjectBuildSettings Other)`
