### FPhysicsReplicationLODSettings


Default settings for physics replication LOD

**属性**:

- `float32 BaseDistanceRadiusMultiplier [Multiplier for adding focal particles bounding box radius to the physics replication LODs Base Distance. Value of 0.75 adds 75% of the radius on top of MinimumBaseDistance.]`
- `float32 BaseDistancesForFullPrediction ['BaseDistance' is a result of MinimumBaseDistance + (the focal particles radius * BaseDistanceRadiusMultiplier)
Set how many BaseDistance's from the focal particle where within physics replicated objects will be in the clients forward predicted timeline.
Physics replication LOD gradually forward predicts the physics replication when objects get closer to focal points in LOD.
Read the TimeOverDistance property for details on how forward prediction is gradually applied up until the distance of DistanceForFullPrediction.
NOTE: The local player is typically forward predicted (and should then be a focal particle in LOD), while other physics replicated objects are typically replicated without forward prediction.
NOTE: The resulting distance will be added on top of the focal particles radius.]`
- `float32 BaseDistancesForResimulationMode ['BaseDistance' is a result of MinimumBaseDistance + (the focal particles radius * BaseDistanceRadiusMultiplier)
Set how many BaseDistance's from the focal particle where within physics replicated objects will use EPhysicsReplicationMode::Resimulation.
Resimulation is a fully forward predicted physics replication, for a seamless LOD transition this should be equal to or lower than BaseDistancesForFullPrediction, read that property for information.
NOTE: The resulting distance will be added on top of the focal particles radius.]`
- `float32 MinimumBaseDistance [Minimum distance in the physics replication LODs Base Distance.]`
- `float32 TimeOverDistance [Time/Distance alignment value, used as Distance * TimeOverDistance = Time
Time is how far behind the current (forward predicted) timeline replication should run
Starts outside of DistanceForFullPrediction (calculated from BaseDistancesForFullPrediction) and gets clamped by the received states timeline.
Lower value = Slower timeline transition which produces a larger LOD radius.
EXAMPLE: At 500cm away an object should be 37,5ms behind the clients timeline if DistanceForFullPrediction is 250cm and TimeOverDistance is 0.15ms/cm. (500cm - 250cm) * 0.15ms/cm = 37,5ms]`
- `bool bEnablePhysicsReplicationLOD [Enable physics replication LOD]`
