### FActiveGameplayEffectHandle


This handle is required for things outside of FActiveGameplayEffectsContainer to refer to a specific active GameplayEffect
    For example if a skill needs to create an active effect and then destroy that specific effect that it created, it has to do so
    through a handle. a pointer or index into the active list is not sufficient. These are not synchronized between clients and server.
