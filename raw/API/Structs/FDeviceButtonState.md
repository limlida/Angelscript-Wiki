### FDeviceButtonState


Current State of a physical device button (mouse, key, etc) at a point in time.
Each "click" of a button should involve at minimum two separate state
events, one where bPressed=true and one where bReleased=true.
Each of these states should occur only once.
In addition there may be additional frames where the button is
held down and bDown=true and bPressed=false.
