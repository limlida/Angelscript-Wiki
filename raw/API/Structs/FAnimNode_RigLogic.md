### FAnimNode_RigLogic


**属性**:

- `FPoseLink AnimSequence`
- `bool CacheAnimCurveNames [* Since the order of anim curves may change even on a frame by frame basis, it is not safe to cache and
* rely on cached indices by default, but if the blueprints feeding anim curves into RigLogic are set up
* in a controlled manner, such that no such runtime changes are expected to the order or number of anim
* curves, caching may improve the performance of the node, especially in low-LOD evaluations.]`
- `int LODThreshold [* Max LOD level that RigLogic Node is evaluated.
* For example if you have the threshold set to 2, it will evaluate until including LOD 2 (based on 0 index). In case the LOD level gets set to 3, it will stop evaluating the Rig Logic.
* Setting it to -1 will always evaluate it.]`


**方法**:

- `FAnimNode_RigLogic& opAssign(FAnimNode_RigLogic Other)`
