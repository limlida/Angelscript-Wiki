### FScriptTypedElementHandle


Script exposure for the typed element handle struct type
Act as a weak handle to simplify the scripting use of the typed element framework and making it safer to use by avoiding crash in case of a bad usage.
This type is the standard way that an element is passed through to interfaces for a script (Blueprint or Python), and also the type that is stored in the script element lists.
C++ code may choose to use TTypedElement instead, which is a combination of an element handle and its associated element interface.

Note: This type shouldn't be used in the engine code as it come with a performance and memory overhead that we want to avoid when compare to the native handles (FTypedElementHandle).

**方法**:

- `bool Equal(FScriptTypedElementHandle RHS) const`  
  Are these two handles equal?
- `bool IsSet() const`  
  Has this handle been initialized to a valid element?
- `bool NotEqual(FScriptTypedElementHandle RHS) const`  
  Are these two handles not equal?
- `Release()`  
  Release this handle and set it back to an empty state.
- `FScriptTypedElementHandle& opAssign(FScriptTypedElementHandle Other)`
