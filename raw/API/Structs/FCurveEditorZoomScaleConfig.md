### FCurveEditorZoomScaleConfig


**属性**:

- `FRuntimeFloatCurve HorizontalZoomScale [Easing function when zooming out on the X-axis using Alt+Shift+RMB + move mouse left/right.

X-value is how far the mouse has travelled on the X-axis. Positive when zooming out, negative when zooming in.
Y-Value is the resulting zoom multiplier. Must be >= 0.0. When zooming out (i.e. x < 0), the Y value must be <= 1.0 or zooming is unstable.
Tip: You can use "CurveEditor.LogHorizontalZoomMultipliers" CVar to make tuning the x and y values easier.

Example:
- For Sequencer, the frame rate is the length of 1 (unit length).
- So if Sequencer's target FPS is set to 30, and 45 frames are visible on the X-Axis in Curve Editor, we say the X-axis is 1.5 units wide.
- We'd look up the value 1.5 in this easing function and use that as zoom multiplier.]`
- `float MaxHorizontalZoomOut [If bLimitHorizontalZoomOut is true, then this max allowed value range the input axis can show.
Example: If this is 1000, and you have zoomed out so the axis shows -200 and 800, you can zoom out no further.

For Sequencer, this is the max number of seconds. So, you need multiply this with the target FPS. So 1000 would mean a max of 3000 frames
with a target FPS of 30.]`
- `float MaxVerticalZoomOut [If bLimitVerticalZoomOut is true, then this max allowed value range the output axis can show.
Example: If this is 1000, and you have zoomed out so the axis shows -200 and 800, you can zoom out no further.]`
- `float MouseWheelZoomMultiplier [Multiplier when zooming uniformly using mouse wheel. 1.0 means normal. Values < 1.0, make zoom 'slower', and > 1.0 zoom 'faster'.]`
- `FRuntimeFloatCurve VerticalZoomScale [Easing function when zooming out on the Y-axis using Alt+RMB + move mouse up/down.

X-value is how far the mouse has travelled on the Y-axis.  Positive when zooming out, negative when zooming in.
Y-Value is the resulting zoom multiplier. Must be >= 0.0. When zooming out (i.e. x < 0), the Y value must be <= 1.0 or zooming is unstable.
Tip: You can use "CurveEditor.LogVerticalZoomMultipliers" CVar to make tuning the x and y values easier.

Example:
- Suppose in Curve Editor, the Y-axis bounds are +2000 to -1000.
- The height of the Y-axis is thus 3000.
- We'd look up the value of 3000 in this easing function and use that as zoom multiplier.]`
- `bool bLimitHorizontalZoomOut [If true, when zooming out using right-click the vertical axis size will be limited.]`
- `bool bLimitVerticalZoomOut [If true, when zooming out using right-click the horizontal axis size will be limited.]`
