Editor Fracture Mode / Utilities / TinyGeo tool
Merge pieces of geometry onto their neighbors -- use it to, for example, clean up too small pieces of geometry.

**属性**:

- `bool AddSamplesForCollision [If enabled, add extra vertices (without triangles) to the geometry in regions where vertices are spaced too far apart (e.g. across large triangles)
These extra vertices will be used as collision samples in particle-implicit collisions, and can help the physics system detect collisions more accurately

Note this is *only* useful for simulations that use particle-implicit collisions]`
- `float32 CollisionSampleSpacing [The number of centimeters to allow between vertices on the mesh surface: If there are gaps larger than this, add additional vertices (without triangles) to help support particle-implicit collisions
Only used if Add Samples For Collision is enabled]`
- `EFixTinyGeoMergeType MergeType [Whether to merge small geometry, or small clusters]`
- `float32 MinVolumeCubeRoot [If size (cube root of volume) is less than this value, geometry should be merged into neighbors -- i.e. a value of 2 merges geometry smaller than a 2x2x2 cube]`
- `EFixTinyGeoNeighborSelectionMethod NeighborSelection []`
- `FLinearColor OverrideColor []`
- `float32 RelativeVolume [If cube root of volume relative to the overall shape's cube root of volume is less than this, the geometry should be merged into its neighbors.
      (Note: This is a bit different from the histogram viewer's "Relative Size," which instead shows values relative to the largest rigid bone.)]`
- `EFixTinyGeoGeometrySelectionMethod SelectionMethod []`
- `EFixTinyGeoUseBoneSelection UseBoneSelection [Options for using the current bone selection]`
- `bool bActive [Used to calculate ContainerElementOffsets]`
- `bool bGeometryOnlySameParent [Only merge geometry to neighbors with the same parent in the hierarchy]`
- `bool bOnFractureLevel [Only consider bones at the current Fracture Level]`
- `bool bOnlyClusters [Only auto-consider clusters for merging. Note that leaf nodes can still be consider if manually selected.]`
- `bool bOnlySameParent [Only merge clusters to neighbors with the same parent in the hierarchy]`
- `bool bOnlyToConnected [Only merge pieces that are connected in the proximity graph.If unchecked, connected pieces will still be favored, but if none are available the closest disconnected piece can be merged.]`
- `bool bOverrideColor []`
- `bool bUseCollectionProximityForConnections [Whether to use the Proximity (as computed by the Proximity node) to determine which bones are connected, and thus can be considered for merging. Otherwise will compute and use a reasonable default connectivity.]`


**方法**:

- `FFixTinyGeoDataflowNode& opAssign(FFixTinyGeoDataflowNode Other)`
