### FAnimNode_StateMachine


State machine node

**属性**:

- `int MaxTransitionsPerFrame [The maximum number of transitions that can be taken by this machine 'simultaneously' in a single frame]`
- `int MaxTransitionsRequests [The maximum number of transition requests that can be buffered at any time.
The oldest transition requests are dropped to accommodate for newly created requests.]`
- `bool bAllowConduitEntryStates [Allows a conduit to be used as this state machine's entry state
If a valid entry state cannot be found at runtime then this will generate a reference pose!]`
- `bool bCreateNotifyMetaData [Tag Notifies with meta data such as the active state and mirroring state.  Producing this
data has a  slight performance cost.]`
- `bool bReinitializeOnBecomingRelevant [Reinitialize the state machine if we have become relevant to the graph
after not being ticked on the previous frame(s)]`
- `bool bSkipFirstUpdateTransition [When the state machine becomes relevant, it is initialized into the Entry state.
It then tries to take any valid transitions to possibly end up in a different state on that same frame.
- if true, that new state starts full weight.
- if false, a blend is created between the entry state and that new state.
In either case all visited State notifications (Begin/End) will be triggered.]`
