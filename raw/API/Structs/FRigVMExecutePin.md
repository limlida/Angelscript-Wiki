### FRigVMExecutePin


This structure is used for semantically describing a pin
on a RigVMStruct - but without any content. So rather than
adding an actual FRigVMExecuteContext this can be added as
the type for a pin and it won't use any memory.
To customize which FRigVMExecuteContext structure to use
on your node you can add the ExecuteContext=FMyExecuteContext
meta data tag on the USTRUCT macro.

**方法**:

- `FRigVMExecutePin& opAssign(FRigVMExecutePin Other)`
