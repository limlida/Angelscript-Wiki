### FPerBoneInterpolation


**属性**:

- `FBoneReference BoneReference []`
- `float32 InterpolationSpeedPerSec [If greater than zero, this is the speed at which the sample weights are allowed to change for this specific bone.

A speed of 1 means a sample weight can change from zero to one (or one to zero) in one second.
A speed of 2 means that this would take half a second.

Smaller values mean slower adjustments of the sample weights, and thus more smoothing. However, a
value of zero disables this smoothing entirely.

If set, the value overrides the overall Sample Weight Speed which will no longer affect this bone.]`


**方法**:

- `FPerBoneInterpolation& opAssign(FPerBoneInterpolation Other)`
