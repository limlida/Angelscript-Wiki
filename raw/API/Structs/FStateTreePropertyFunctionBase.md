### FStateTreePropertyFunctionBase


Base struct for all property functions.
PropertyFunction is a node which is executed just before evaluating owner's bindings.

The property function's instance data is expected to have one property marked as output.
This property is used to find which properties the function can be used for,
and that property is hidden in the UI. It is expected that there's just one output property.

Example:

    USTRUCT()
    struct FStateTreeBooleanOperationPropertyFunctionInstanceData
    {
            GENERATED_BODY()

            UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Param)
            bool bLeft = false;

            UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Param)
            bool bRight = false;

     // This property is used to find which properties the function can be used for.
            UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = Output)
            bool bResult = false;
    };

**属性**:

- `FName Name [Name of the node.]`


**方法**:

- `FStateTreePropertyFunctionBase& opAssign(FStateTreePropertyFunctionBase Other)`
