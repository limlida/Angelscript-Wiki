### UAbilityAsync


AbilityAsync is a base class for ability-specific BlueprintAsyncActions.
These are similar to ability tasks, but they can be executed from any blueprint like an actor and are not tied to a specific ability lifespan.
By default these actions are only kept alive by the blueprint graph that spawns them and will eventually be destroyed if the graph instance is deleted or spawns a replacement.
EndAction should be called when a one-time action has succeeded or failed, but for longer-lived actions with multiple triggers it can be called from blueprints.

**方法**:

- `EndAction()`  
  Explicitly end the action, will disable any callbacks and allow action to be destroyed
- `Activate()`
