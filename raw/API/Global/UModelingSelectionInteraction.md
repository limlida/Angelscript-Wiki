### UModelingSelectionInteraction


UModelingSelectionInteraction provides element-level selection behavior (ie mesh triangles/edges/vertices)
via the UGeometrySelectionManager. The Interaction doesn't actually know about the meshes or interact
with them at all, it simply "operates" the SelectionManager based on user input.

In addition to handling selection/deselection behaviors based on user input, the UModelingSelectionInteraction
also creates a Gizmo for the active selection if it is transformable, and forwards gizmo transformations
to the SelectionManager.

Currently some desired Selection-related interactions require a slightly convoluted path through the code,
because (for example) we want the standard UE editor gizmo to have "click precedence" over our selection
click behaviors. However we will get the input event first, so we need to be able to check if the gizmo is
hit via a callback function provided by the EdMode owning the ToolsContext this Interaction will be registered in.
Similarly we need to be able to filter out hits if a closer visible object is hit, because there is
no higher-level Behavior that will do that for us. (This may be improved in future, if more of the existing
Editor interaction behaviors are re-implemented as InputBehaviors)
