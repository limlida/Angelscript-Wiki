### UKeyInputBehavior


UKeyInputBehavior provides a keyboard capturing behavior that works with single or multiple keys. Provided with a single key, the behavior triggers
OnKeyPressed and OnKeyReleased events upon seeing the target key pressed down and released for the first time, ignoring any other key presses.
When provided with multiple keys, the Behavior has variable behavior depending on whether bRequireAllKeys is set.

If true, the behavior sequence is as follows:

  1. Initiate capture when any of the target keys are pressed.
  2. Continue capture until all target keys are pressed simultaneously
  3. Upon seeing the last key to complete the full set of target keys, issue an OnKeyPressed for whichever key completed the requirement.
            3b. If any of the target keys are released after the full set was pressed, issue an OnKeyReleased for whichever key was released, then end Capture.
  4. If at any point all target keys are released after capture begins, end capture.

If false, the behavior sequence is as follows:

  1. Initiate capture when any of the target keys are pressed.
  2. Continue capture while any of the target keys are still pressed.
  3. Issue an OnKeyPressed for any target key pressed during the capture period.
  4. Issue an OnKeyReleased for any target key released during the capture period.
  5. If at any point all target keys are released, end capture.
