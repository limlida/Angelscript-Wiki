### UDamageType


A DamageType is intended to define and describe a particular form of damage and to provide an avenue
for customizing responses to damage from various sources.

For example, a game could make a DamageType_Fire set it up to ignite the damaged actor.

DamageTypes are never instanced and should be treated as immutable data holders with static code
functionality.  They should never be stateful.

**属性**:

- `float32 DamageFalloff [Damage fall-off for radius damage (exponent).  Default 1.0=linear, 2.0=square of distance, etc.]`
- `float32 DamageImpulse [The magnitude of impulse to apply to the Actors damaged by this type.]`
- `float32 DestructibleDamageSpreadScale [How much the damage spreads on a destructible mesh]`
- `float32 DestructibleImpulse [How large the impulse should be applied to destructible meshes]`
- `bool bCausedByWorld [True if this damagetype is caused by the world (falling off level, into lava, etc).]`
- `bool bRadialDamageVelChange [When applying radial impulses, whether to treat as impulse or velocity change.]`
- `bool bScaleMomentumByMass [True to scale imparted momentum by the receiving pawn's mass for pawns using character movement]`
