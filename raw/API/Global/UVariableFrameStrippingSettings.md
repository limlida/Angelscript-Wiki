### UVariableFrameStrippingSettings


* This is a wrapper for the Variable frame stripping Codec.
* It allows for the mass changing of settings on animation sequences in an editor accessible way.

**属性**:

- `FPerPlatformInt FrameStrippingRate [The number of Frames that are stripped down to one.
Allows for overrides of that multiplier.
FrameStrippingRate == 1 would strip no frames, Therefore this is clamped to 2.]`
- `FPerPlatformBool UseVariableFrameStripping [Enables the change from standard 1/2 frame stripping to stripping a higher amount of frames per frame kept]`
