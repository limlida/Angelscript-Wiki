**属性**:

- `FLinearColor LuminanceFactors [* Luminance factors for converting a color to greyscale.
*
* The default luminance factors values are now derived from the working color space. For uses cases
* outside scene rendering, users are responsible for updating these factors accordingly. For example,
* factors derived from an AP1 working color space would not be applicable to UI domain materials that
* remain in sRGB/Rec.709 and thus should instead use approximately [0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722].]`
