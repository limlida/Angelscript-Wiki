### USlateRHIPostBufferProcessor


Base class for types that can process the backbuffer scene into the slate post buffer.

Implement 'PostProcess' in your derived class. Additionally, you need to create a renderthread proxy that derives from 'FSlateRHIPostBufferProcessorProxy'
For an example see: USlatePostBufferBlur.
