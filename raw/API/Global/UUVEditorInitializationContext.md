### UUVEditorInitializationContext


An editor-only context used specifically to pass data from the asset editor to the
mode when that data is not meant to be used by the tools. This allows a mode
to be prepped before its first Enter() call even when it doesn't exist yet.

Data/api's that are meant to be used by the tools would usually be placed into
other, non-editor-only context objects (UUVToolLivePreviewAPI, etc).
