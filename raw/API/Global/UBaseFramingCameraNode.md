### UBaseFramingCameraNode


The base class for a standard scren-space framing camera node.

**属性**:

- `FCameraFramingZoneParameter DeadZone [The size of the dead zone, i.e. the zone inside which the target can freely move.
Sizes are expressed screen percentages around the desired framing location.]`
- `FFloatCameraParameter DisengageTime [The time spent ramping down the reframing after entering the dead zone.
If set to zero or a negative value, reframing will immediately stop once the target has
entered the dead zone. Otherwise, the ReframeDampingFactor will interpolate towards zero
over the specified amount of seconds.]`
- `FVector2dCameraParameter IdealFramingLocation [The ideal horizontal and vertical screen-space position of the target.]`
- `FBooleanCameraParameter InitializeWithIdealFraming [Whether to frame the target with the ideal framing immediately on the first frame.]`
- `FFloatCameraParameter LowReframeDampingFactor [If valid, the recentering damping factor will interpolate between LowReframeDampingFactor
and ReframeDampingFactor as the target moves between the ideal target position and the
boundaries of the hard-zone. If invalid, no interpolation occurs and the damping factor
is always equal to ReframeDampingFactor.]`
- `FFloatCameraParameter ReengageTime [The time spent ramping up the reframing after exiting the dead zone.
If set to zero or a negative value, reframing will immediately restart once the target
has exited the dead zone. Otherwise the ReframeDampingFactor will interpolate from zero to
its desired value over the specified amount of seconds.]`
- `FFloatCameraParameter ReframeDampingFactor [The damping factor for how fast the framing recenters on the target.]`
- `FBooleanCameraParameter SetTargetDistance [Whether the camera pose's target distance should be set to the distance between
its location and the effective target's location.]`
- `FCameraFramingZoneParameter SoftZone [The margins of the soft zone, i.e. the zone inside which the reframing will engage, in order
to bring the target back towards the ideal framing position. If the target is outside of the
soft zone, it will be forcibly and immedialy brought back to its edges, so this zone also
defines the "hard" or "safe" zone of framing.
Sizes are expressed in screen percentages from the edges.]`
- `TArray<FCameraActorTargetInfo> TargetInfos [Specifies one or more target actors to frame.]`
- `FVector3dCameraVariableReference TargetLocation [A variable whose value is the desired target's location in world space.
If set, and if the variable has been set, the obtained value takes priority
over the TargetInfos property.]`
- `FFloatCameraParameter TargetMovementAnticipationTime []`
