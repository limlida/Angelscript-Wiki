### UK2Node_MathExpression


This node type acts like a collapsed node, a single node that represents
a larger sub-network of nodes (contained within a sub-graph). This node will
take the math expression it was named with, and attempt to convert it into a
series of math nodes. If it is unsuccessful, then it generates a series of
actionable errors.
