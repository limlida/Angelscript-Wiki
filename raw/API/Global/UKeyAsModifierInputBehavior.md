### UKeyAsModifierInputBehavior


UKeyAsModifierInputBehavior converts a specific key press/release into
a "Modifier" toggle via the IModifierToggleBehaviorTarget interface. It does
not capture the key press; rather, it updates the modifier its WantsCapture call.
This means that the modifier won't be updated if another behavior captures the
keyboard.
