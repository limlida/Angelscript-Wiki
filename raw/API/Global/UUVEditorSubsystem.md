### UUVEditorSubsystem


The subsystem is meant to hold any UV editor operations that are not UI related (those are
handled by the toolkit); however, in our case, most of our operations are wrapped up inside
tools and the UV mode.
Instead, the subsystem deals with some global UV asset editor things- it manages existing
instances (we can't rely on the asset editor subsystem for this because the UV editor is
not the primary editor for meshes), and figures out what we can launch the editor on.
