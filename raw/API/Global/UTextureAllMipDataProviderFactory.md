### UTextureAllMipDataProviderFactory


UTextureAllMipDataProviderFactory defines an interface to create instances of FTextureMipDataProvider.
Derived classes from UTextureAllMipDataProviderFactory can be attached to UTexture2D
to define a new source for all of the mip data (instead of the default disk file or ddc mips).
Use cases include custom texture compression.
