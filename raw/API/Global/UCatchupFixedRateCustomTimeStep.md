### UCatchupFixedRateCustomTimeStep


Control the Engine TimeStep via a fixed frame rate that catches up with real time.

  - Stays in sync with platform time.
  - Blocks to prevent getting ahead of real time.
  - Does not block when it needs to catch up
  - If it falls behind too much, it will increase simulation delta times.

**属性**:

- `FFrameRate FrameRate [Desired simulation frame rate]`
- `float MaxCatchupSeconds [Maximum catchup time in seconds. Simulation will catch up instantly if it falls behind beyond this time with respect to platform time]`
