### USlateRHIRendererSettings


Settings used to control slate rendering

**属性**:

- `TMap<ESlatePostRT,FSlatePostSettings> SlatePostSettings [Map of all slate post RT's and their settings
Note that each post RT used in a frame will result in 1 full framebuffer copy for slate to sample from.
If a post RT is not used, no copy will occur & that post RT will be resized to 1x1 after 2 frames of non-use.

By default only SlatePostRT_0 is enabled. The rest must manually be enabled in settings below.
        // Map is nice since needs no editor customization. After initial run there should be no more than 5 lookups each frame.]`


**方法**:

- `FSlatePostSettings& GetMutableSlatePostSetting(ESlatePostRT InPostBufferBit)`  
  Get settings struct for a particular post buffer index
- `FSlatePostSettings GetSlatePostSetting(ESlatePostRT InPostBufferBit) const`
