### UAbilityTask_StartAbilityState


An ability state is simply an ability task that provides a way to handle the ability being interrupted.
You can use ability states to do state-specific cleanup if the ability ends or was interrupted at a certain point during it's execution.

An ability state will always result in either 'OnStateEnded' or 'OnStateInterrupted' being called.

'OnStateEnded' will be called if:
- The ability itself ends via AGameplayAbility::EndAbility
- The ability state is manually ended via AGameplayAbility::EndAbilityState
- Another ability state is started will 'bEndCurrentState' set to true

'OnStateInterrupted' will be called if:
- The ability itself is cancelled via AGameplayAbility::CancelAbility

**属性**:

- `FAbilityStateDelegate OnStateEnded [Invoked if 'EndAbilityState' is called or if 'EndAbility' is called and this state is active.]`
- `FAbilityStateDelegate OnStateInterrupted [Invoked if the ability was interrupted and this state is active.]`
