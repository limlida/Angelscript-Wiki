### UNiagaraDataInterfaceDataChannelRead


The Data Channel Reader Data Interface allows us to read from a Niagara Data Channel.
It also allows us to spawn particles into emitters in this system based upon the entries in a Niagara Data Channel.

**属性**:

- `FNDCAccessContextInst AccessContext [Access Context used when accessing NDC data. Controls which of the NDCs internal data it will return for this Interface to read. Can be empty for Systems using bAutoLinkToSpawningNDC.]`
- `UNiagaraDataChannelAsset Channel [The data channel to access and read from.]`
- `bool bAutoLinkToSpawningNDC [If true this DI will attempt to automatically link itself to the NDC it's being spawned by.]`
- `bool bOnlySpawnOnceOnSubticks [If a system is ticking multiple times in a single frame (for example due to fixed tick delta time or because the user is scrubbing the desired time in the timeline),
it is usually not desirable to also spawn new particles every tick for the data channel entries, as the data channel itself doesn't change.

When enabled, the emitter will only spawn particles on the last subtick of the frame.]`
- `bool bOverrideSpawnGroupToDataChannelIndex [When true, Emitter.Spawn group for any spawned particles will be overridden to the index of the data channel element that generated that spawn.
Doing this will submit all NDC spawns individually and will be less performant.
However it will allow particles to access the NDC data that generated then via the SpawnGroup value.
It will also mean that Exec Index will be correct on a per NDC Entry level.
Without this settings ExecIndex will be 0...TotalSpawnCount-1. With this it will be 0...SpawnCount for each NDC item individually.
Unless absolutely needed this is discouraged as it comes at significant performance cost when spawning and GPU emitters can currently only handle 8 individual spawns per frame.
Calling GetNDCSpawnInfo() in the particle spawn script to get the spawning NDC Index is preferred.]`
- `bool bReadCurrentFrame [If this interface should read the current frame's data from the Data Channel. If false, the interface will read from the previous frame if it's available.

Reading the current frame allows us to use the most current data and have the least possible latency from the source.
However, it introduces a tick order dependency between this read and the Blueprints, Game Code or other Niagara Systems writing into this Data Channel.
If this interface reads data before those writing to the Data Channel have executed, then that data will be missed.

Reading the previous frame allows us to avoid this tick order dependency.
We can be sure we are reading all data that is written to the Data Channel, regardless of when the writes happened in the frame.
However it does introduce a 1 frame delay in the data being read and so can cause latency/lag.]`
- `bool bUpdateSourceDataEveryTick [The source Data Channel data for this interface will be refreshed every frame.
Some Data Channels have multiple separate data elements for things such as spatial subdivision.
Each DI will request the correct one for it's owning system instance from the data channel.
Depending on the Data Channel this could be an expensive search so we should avoid doing this every tick if possible.
However it may be required. For example if the Niagara System is moving and reading from a spatially sub-divided NDC such as the Islands type.]`
