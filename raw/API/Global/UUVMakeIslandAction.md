### UUVMakeIslandAction


Action that takes the currently selected triangles and makes a separate UV island out of them,
 i.e. any interior seams are removed, and seams are added around the boundary of the selection.
 If the selection is not connected in the mesh, islands will be created for each connected
 component of selected triangles. If some of the selected triangles have unset UVs, they will
 be initialized to 0 for the purposes to creating an island. The output is the triangles of
 the created islands.
An unwrap operation on the island is typically a good thing to follow this action.
