### ULocalDoubleClickInputBehavior


An implementation of UDoubleClickInputBehavior that also implements IClickBehaviorTarget directly, via a set
of local lambda functions. To use/customize this class, the client replaces the lambda functions with their own.
This avoids having to create a separate IClickBehaviorTarget implementation for trivial use-cases.
