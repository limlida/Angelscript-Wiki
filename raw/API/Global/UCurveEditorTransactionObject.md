### UCurveEditorTransactionObject


The object type that the transaction system associates FCommandChanges for the FCurveEditor with.

By design, the transaction system requires a UObject to associate FCommandChanges with. This is usually an asset.
Conceptually, instances of this class will act as an "asset" and the associated FCurveEditor contains the "asset data", i.e. its  FCurveModels.
