### UInterchangeTransformAnimationTrackNode


Class to represent an animation on the transform of a camera, light, or scene node.

**方法**:

- `bool GetCustomUsedChannels(int& AttributeValue) const`  
  Get which channels of this animation should be used. This is a bitmask.
See SetCustomUsedChannels for description of bitmask
- `bool SetCustomUsedChannels(int AttributeValue)`  
  Set which channels of this animation should be used. This is a bitwise mask.
Bits are interpreted as follow:
   None          = 0x000,
   TranslationX  = 0x001,
   TranslationY  = 0x002,
   TranslationZ  = 0x004,
   Translation   = TranslationX | TranslationY | TranslationZ,
   RotationX     = 0x008,
   RotationY     = 0x010,
   RotationZ     = 0x020,
   Rotation      = RotationX | RotationY | RotationZ,
   ScaleX        = 0x040,
   ScaleY        = 0x080,
   ScaleZ        = 0x100,
   Scale         = ScaleX | ScaleY | ScaleZ,
   AllTransform  = Translation | Rotation | Scale,
   Weight        = 0x200,
   All           = Translation | Rotation | Scale | Weight,
