### UNamedSlot


Allows you to expose an external slot for your user widget.  When others reuse your user control,
they can put whatever they want in this named slot.

**属性**:

- `bool bExposeOnInstanceOnly [Named slots exposed on the instance only follow a slightly different set of rules.  For example, they can contain
some content that the user can replace after dropping it into their tree.  However, these slots can not be inherited
to be filled in by a subclass.  So if you want this named slot to be extensible in a subclass of this widget, you
should set or leave this value as false.]`
