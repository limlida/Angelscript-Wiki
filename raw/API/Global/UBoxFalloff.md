### UBoxFalloff


Box scalar field that will be defined only within a box

**属性**:

- `float32 Default [The field value will be set to Default if the sample distance from the box is higher than the scale of the transform]`
- `EFieldFalloffType Falloff [Type of falloff function used to model the evolution of the field from the box surface to the sample position]`
- `float32 Magnitude [Magnitude of the box falloff field]`
- `float32 MaxRange [The initial function value between 0 and 1 will be scaled between MinRange and MaxRange before being multiplied by magnitude]`
- `float32 MinRange [The initial function value between 0 and 1 will be scaled between MinRange and MaxRange before being multiplied by magnitude]`
- `FTransform Transform [Translation, Rotation and Scale of the unit box]`


**方法**:

- `UBoxFalloff SetBoxFalloff(float32 Magnitude, float32 MinRange, float32 MaxRange, float32 Default, FTransform Transform, EFieldFalloffType Falloff)`
