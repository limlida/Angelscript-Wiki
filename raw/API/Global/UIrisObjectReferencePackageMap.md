### UIrisObjectReferencePackageMap


Custom packagemap implementation used to be able to capture exports such as UObject* references, names and NetTokens from external serialization.
Exports written when using this packagemap will be captured in an array and serialized as an index.
When reading using this packagemap exports will be read as an index and resolved by picking the corresponding entry from the provided array containing the data associated with the export.
