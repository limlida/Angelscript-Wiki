### UFractureConvexSettings


Settings controlling how convex hulls are generated for geometry collections

**属性**:

- `float CanExceedFraction [Fraction (of geometry volume) by which a cluster's convex hull volume can exceed the actual geometry volume before instead using the hulls of the children.  0 means the convex volume cannot exceed the geometry volume; 1 means the convex volume is allowed to be 100% larger (2x) the geometry volume.]`
- `float FractionAllowRemove [Fraction of the convex hulls for a cluster that we can remove before using the hulls of the children]`
- `float32 LineThickness [line thickness]`
- `float OverlapRemovalShrinkPercent [Overlap removal will be computed as if convex hulls were this percentage smaller (in range 0-100)]`
- `EConvexOverlapRemoval RemoveOverlaps [Whether to automatically cut away overlapping parts of the convex hulls, to avoid the simulation 'popping' to fix the overlaps]`
- `float SimplificationDistanceThreshold [We simplify the convex shape to keep points spaced at least this far apart (except to keep the hull from collapsing to zero volume)]`
- `bool bSeeThroughLines [When enabled, convex visualization lines will show through the actual geometry]`
