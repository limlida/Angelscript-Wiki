### UUVToolSelectionAPI


API for dealing with mode-level selection in the UV editor.

Selections are stored in a list of objects, one object per asset that contains a
selection, all of the same type (vert/edge/tri), none empty. Selections are
considered to be referring to the UnwrapCanonical mesh of the corresponding target.

There are also functions to enable automatic highlighting of the current selection,
and to enable a selection mechanic in the viewport (to which tools can respond via
OnSelectionChanged broadcasts).
