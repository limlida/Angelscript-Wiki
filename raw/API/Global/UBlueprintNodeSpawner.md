### UBlueprintNodeSpawner


Intended to be wrapped and used by FBlueprintActionMenuItem. Rather than
sub-classing the menu item, we choose to subclass this instead (for
different node types). That way, we get the type inference that comes with
UObjects (and we don't have to continuously compare identification strings).
