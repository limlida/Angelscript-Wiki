### UPackageFileValidator


This validator checks the format of the package on disk to make sure that is has not become corrupted since it was last saved.

To disable the validator entirely, set ini:Editor:[/Script/DataValidation.PackageFileValidator]:bIsConfigDisabled=true
To disable validation of payload hashes (which is much slower than the rest of the validation) set
ini:Editor:[/Script/DataValidation.PackageFileValidator]:bValidatePayloadHashes=true
