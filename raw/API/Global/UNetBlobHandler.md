### UNetBlobHandler


A UNetBlobHandler is responsible for creating and processing a single type of NetBlob.
If the handler should be able to receive blobs it needs to be configured in
UNetBlobHandlerDefinitions and registered to the UReplicationSystem on both the
sending and receiving side.
@see UReplicationSystem::RegisterNetBlobHandler
@note Certain handlers such as NetRPCHandler, PartialNetObjectAttachmentHandler and NetObjectBlobHandler will be registered automatically.
