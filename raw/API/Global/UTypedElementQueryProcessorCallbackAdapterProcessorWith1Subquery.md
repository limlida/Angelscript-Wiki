### UTypedElementQueryProcessorCallbackAdapterProcessorWith1Subquery


Mass verifies that queries that are used by processors are on the processor themselves. It does this by taking the address of the query
and seeing if it's within the start and end address of the processor. When a dynamic array is used those addresses are going to be
elsewhere, so the two options are to store a single fixed size array on a processor or have multiple instances. With Mass' queries being
not an insignificant size it's preferable to have several variants with queries to allow the choice for the minimal size. Unfortunately
UHT doesn't allow for templates so it had to be done in an explicit way.
