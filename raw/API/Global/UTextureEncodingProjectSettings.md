### UTextureEncodingProjectSettings


Encoding can either use the "Final" or "Fast" speeds, for supported encoders (e.g. Oodle)
Encode speed settings have no effect on encoders that don't support encode speed, currently limited to Oodle.

**属性**:

- `ETextureEncodeSpeed CookUsesSpeed [Which encode speed non interactive editor sessions will use (i.e. commandlets)]`
- `ETextureEncodeSpeed EditorUsesSpeed [Which encode speed everything else uses.]`
- `ETextureEncodeEffort FastEffortLevel [Specifies how much time to take trying for better encode results.]`
- `int8 FastRDOLambda [Ignored if UsesRDO is false. This value is used if a given texture is using "Default" LossyCompressionAmount.
Otherwise, the value of LossyCompressionAmount is translated in to a fixed lambda (see UsesRDO tooltip).

Low values (1) represent highest quality (least distortion) results.]`
- `ETextureUniversalTiling FastUniversalTiling [Specifies how to assume textures are laid out on disc. This only applies to Oodle with RDO
enabled. 256 KB is a good middle ground. Enabling this will decrease the on-disc
sizes of textures for platforms with exposed texture tiling (i.e. consoles), but will slightly increase
sizes of textures for platforms with opaque tiling (i.e. desktop).]`
- `ETextureEncodeEffort FinalEffortLevel [Specifies how much time to take trying for better encoding results.]`
- `int8 FinalRDOLambda [Ignored if UsesRDO is false. This value is used if a given texture is using "Default" LossyCompressionAmount.
Otherwise, the value of LossyCompressionAmount is translated in to a fixed lambda (see UsesRDO tooltip).

Low values (1) represent highest quality (least distortion) results.]`
- `ETextureUniversalTiling FinalUniversalTiling [Specifies how to assume textures are laid out on disc. This only applies to Oodle with RDO
enabled. 256 KB is a good middle ground. Enabling this will decrease the on-disc
sizes of textures for platforms with exposed texture tiling (i.e. consoles), but will slightly increase
sizes of textures for platforms with opaque tiling (i.e. desktop).]`
- `bool bFastUsesRDO [If true, Final encode speed enables rate-distortion optimization on supported encoders to
decrease *on disc* size of textures in compressed package files.
This rate-distortion tradeoff is controlled via "Lambda". The "LossyCompressionAmount" parameter on
textures is used to control it. Specific LossyCompressionAmount values correspond to
to RDO lambdas of:

      None - Disable RDO for this texture.
      Lowest - 1 (Least distortion)
      Low - 10
      Medium - 20
      High - 30
      Highest - 40

If set to Default, then the LossyCompressionAmount in the LODGroup for the texture is
used. If that is also Default, then the RDOLambda in these settings is used.

Note that any distortion introduced is on top of, and likely less than, any introduced by the format itself.]`
- `bool bFinalUsesRDO [If true, Final encode speed enables rate-distortion optimization on supported encoders to
decrease *on disc* size of textures in compressed package files.
This rate-distortion tradeoff is controlled via "Lambda". The "LossyCompressionAmount" parameter on
textures is used to control it. Specific LossyCompressionAmount values correspond to
to RDO lambdas of:

      None - Disable RDO for this texture.
      Lowest - 1 (Least distortion)
      Low - 10
      Medium - 20
      High - 30
      Highest - 40

If set to Default, then the LossyCompressionAmount in the LODGroup for the texture is
used. If that is also Default, then the RDOLambda in these settings is used.

Note that any distortion introduced is on top of, and likely less than, any introduced by the format itself.]`
- `bool bSharedLinearTextureEncoding [If true, platforms that want to take a linearly encoded texture and then tile them
will try to reuse the linear texture rather than encode it for every platform. This can result in
massive speedups for texture building as tiling is very fast compared to encoding. So instead of:

      Host Platform: Linear encode
      Console 1: Linear encode + platform specific tile
      Console 2: Linear encode + platform specific tile

you instead get:
      Host platform: Linear encode
      Console 1: fetch linear + platform specific tile
      Console 2: fetch linear + platform specific tile

Note that this has no effect on cook time, only build time - once the texture is in the DDC this has no
effect.]`
