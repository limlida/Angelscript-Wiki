### ULandscapeHeightmapNormalsEditLayerRenderer


Edit layer renderer added at the top of the stack to generate the normals, right before resolving the textures.
 For now, the rendered components require (up to) their 8 immediate neighbors to generate adequate normals on the border so the renderer inserts that strong dependency, so that the components
 that are needed in the batch are guaranteed to have their neighbors present in the same batch :
