### ULandscapeDefaultEditLayerRenderer


Edit layer renderer added at the bottom of the stack to provide the default value for every requested target layer (heightmaps and weightmaps)
 It could have been handled with a simple clear as the first operation when performing the merge, but doing it through a renderer turns out to be an elegant way to resolve the
 situation where the first actual edit layer's render item declares dependencies between each component and others (e.g. say you have only a ULandscapeHeightmapNormalsEditLayerRenderer
 in the renderer stack, which requires each component's immediate neighbors). In such a situation, the component dependencies would be skipped because dependencies are
 between a renderer and its previous one in the stack and since in the case described above (a single renderer in the stack), there's no previous renderer, then the dependencies
 would simply not be registered, and the render batches would end up being incorrect as a result.
