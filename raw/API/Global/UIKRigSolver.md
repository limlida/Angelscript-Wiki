### UIKRigSolver


NOTE on UIKRigSolver upgrade path:
In 5.6 the UObject's in IK Rig have been replaced with runtime-friendly UStruct based data structures
As part of this change, solvers based on UIKRigSolver will no longer function and must be upgraded to the new base FIKRigSolverBase.
Old assets using UIKRigSolver-based solvers can be loaded and patched using the ConvertToInstancedStruct() function (see below)
All solvers that ship with the IKRig plugin have been ported to the new system and should work exactly as before.
