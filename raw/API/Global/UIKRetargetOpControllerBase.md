### UIKRetargetOpControllerBase


This is the base class for defining a custom controller for a given retarget op type.
Controllers provide an API for editing ops from blueprint or python.

To use a controller:
1. Get a controller by calling UIKRetargeterController::GetOpController(int InOpIndex)
2. Cast the returned UIKRetargetOpControllerBase* to the type of controller used by the op you want to modify.
3. Call the public getter/setters to modify the op as desired

NOTE: these controllers are necessary because the op UStructs do not support UFunctions
