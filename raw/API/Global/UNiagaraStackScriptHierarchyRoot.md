### UNiagaraStackScriptHierarchyRoot


A script's stack hierarchy root, representing a UNiagaraHierarchyRoot object in the stack.
It creates categories and inputs equivalent to the children of the UNiagaraHierarchyRoot it represents.
In addition, input parameters that have not been added to the hierarchy explicitly are added at the end as well.
This avoids that hierarchy setup is _required_, and instead becomes optional
