### UImportTestFunctionsBase


This is the base class for any static class which provides test functions for an asset type.
Note that test functions defined in derived classes must be defined as UFUNCTION(Exec)
This ensures that default parameters are held as metadata.
However these functions are in reality not designed to be called from the console.
@todo: create an alternative UFUNCTION tag for exporting default parameters as metadata.
