### UAnimationModifiersAssetUserData


Asset user data which can be added to a USkeleton or UAnimSequence to keep track of Animation Modifiers

**属性**:

- `TArray<TObjectPtr<UAnimationModifier>> AnimationModifierInstances []`
- `TMap<FSoftObjectPath,TObjectPtr<UAnimationModifier>> AppliedModifiers [Animation modifiers APPLIED on the owning animation sequence

- Key = Modifier in AnimationModifierInstances of owning animation sequence or skeleton
- Value = Modifier instance applied

Applied modifier instances stores (Properties, RevisionGuid, ...) at Apply Time
Which are not visible or editable from user interface

In contrast, modifiers in AnimationModifierInstances
are objects displayed at the Animation Data Modifier window
Where Properties are displayed for user editing anytime

Note, Modifier on Skeleton (MoS) applied instances are stored on each
animation sequence's asset user data, instead of the skeleton's
this design is important to enable applied modifiers can be reverted for each sequence
also ensure applying MoS (when [re]importing animation) will not affect the skeleton asset

The only time MoS stores an applied instance here is upgrading from previous version
The "UAnimationModifier::PreviouslyAppliedModifier_DEPRECATED" data will be migrated here
To support proper revert for them
For more compatibility handling, check UAnimationModifier::PostLoad() and GetAppliedModifier()]`
