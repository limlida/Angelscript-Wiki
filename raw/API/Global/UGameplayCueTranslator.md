### UGameplayCueTranslator


This is the base class for GameplayCue Translators. This is what games must extend from in order to add their own rules.
These are not instantiated, and are basically just a holder for virtual functions that are called on the CDO.

There are two main things this class provides:
        1. A set of translation rules. E.g., "I translate GameplayCue.A.B.C into GameplayCue.X.B.C", or rather "I translate A into X". (GetTranslationNameSpawns)
        2. A runtime function to actually do the translation, based on the actors and parameters involved in the gameplay cue event. (GameplayCueToTranslationIndex)
