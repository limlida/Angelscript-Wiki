UEditorAssetSubsystem
Subsystem for exposing asset related utilities to scripts.
Asset Paths can be represented in the following ways:
             (Reference/Text Path)   StaticMesh'/Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset'
             (Full Name)                             StaticMesh /Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset
             (Path Name)                             /Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset
             (Package Name)                  /Game/MyFolder/MyAsset
Directory Paths can be represented in the following ways:
             /Game/MyNewFolder/
             /Game/MyNewFolder

**方法**:

- `AddOnExtractAssetFromFile(FOnExtractAssetFromFileDynamic__EditorAssetSubsystem Delegate = FOnExtractAssetFromFileDynamic__EditorAssetSubsystem ( ))`  
  Call this to add a callback to extract an asset from a file,
for example from a drag and drop operation.
- `bool CheckoutAsset(FString AssetToCheckout)`  
  Checkout an asset.
@param       AssetToCheckout         Asset Path of the asset that we want to checkout.
@return      True if the operation succeeds.
- `bool CheckoutDirectory(FString DirectoryPath, bool bRecursive = true)`  
  Checkout all assets in a directory. It will load the assets if needed.
All objects that are in the directory will be checked out. Assets will be loaded before being checked out.
@param       DirectoryPath           Directory of the assets to be checked out.
@param       bRecursive                      If the AssetPath is a folder, the search will be recursive and will checkout the assets in the sub folders.
@return      True if the operation succeeds.
- `bool CheckoutLoadedAsset(UObject AssetToCheckout)`  
  Checkout the asset corresponding to an object.
@param       AssetToCheckout         Asset to checkout.

- `bool ConsolidateAssets(UObject AssetToConsolidateTo, TArray<UObject> AssetsToConsolidate)`  
  Consolidates assets by replacing all references/uses of the provided AssetsToConsolidate with references to AssetToConsolidateTo.
This is useful when you want all references of assets to be replaced by a single asset.
The function first attempts to directly replace all relevant references located within objects that are already loaded and in memory.
Next, it deletes the AssetsToConsolidate, leaving behind object redirectors to AssetToConsolidateTo.
@param       AssetToConsolidateTo    Asset to which all references of the AssetsToConsolidate will instead refer to after this operation completes.

@note        Modified objects will be saved if the operation succeeds.
