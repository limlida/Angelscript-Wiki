### UTickableWorldSubsystem


UTickableWorldSubsystem
Base class for auto instanced and initialized systems that share the lifetime of a UWorld and are ticking along with it.
With the default implementation, it will start ticking after Initialize and stop during Deinitialize,
and it will call IsTickable every frame (defaults to true) before calling Tick.
Subclasses must forward calls to the Initialize/Deinitialize functions to correctly enable ticking.
