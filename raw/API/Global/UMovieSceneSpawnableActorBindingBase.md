### UMovieSceneSpawnableActorBindingBase


The base class for actor-specific spawnable bindings. Contains a default implementation that can handle spawning an Actor from provided Actor class and optional Actor template.
Can be overridden in C++ or blueprint to provide an Actor class and to add custom PostSpawnObject behavior such as mesh setup based on an asset.
The below UMovieSceneSpawnableActorBinding class implements this base class and replicates the old FMovieSceneSpawnable behavior by using a specified Actor template to spawn an Actor and can be used out of the box.

**属性**:

- `FName LevelName [Name of level to spawn into]`
- `bool bNetAddressableName [When enabled, the actor will be spawned with a unique name so that it can be addressable between clients and servers.]`
