### UMovieSceneSequenceTickManager


Global (one per-UWorld) manager object that manages ticking and updating any and all Sequencer-based
evaluations for the current frame, before any other actors are ticked.

Ticking clients are registered based on their desired tick interval, and grouped together with other
clients that tick with the same interval (based on Sequencer.TickIntervalGroupingResolutionMs).

Sequencer data is shared between all instances within the same group, allowing them to blend together.
Clients ticking at different intervals do not support blending with each other.
