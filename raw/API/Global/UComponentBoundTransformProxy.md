### UComponentBoundTransformProxy


A variant of a transform proxy whose transform is always bound to a particular component. This means
 that if the component is moved as a result of its parents moving, the proxy will get that transform
 when queried. This makes the transform proxy very useful for being bound to sub gizmos that are moved
 by some parent gizmo. SetTransform will cause the proxy to set the transform on the bound component
 even if it is not part of its component set (to stay matched with the component) so AddComponent is
 not necessary for the bound component (nor is it likely to be used with this proxy, see below).

This class is mainly intended to be bound to a single component and used for its delegates. It can
 still be used for the multi-component movement functionality of a transform proxy, but it is worth
 noting in that case that if the bound component is moved by its parent, the other components won't
 necessarily be moved unless SetTransform() is called on the proxy (or they happen to be parented in
 the same subtree).
