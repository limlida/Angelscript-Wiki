### UPawnMovementComponent


PawnMovementComponent can be used to update movement for an associated Pawn.
It also provides ways to accumulate and read directional input in a generic way (with AddInputVector(), ConsumeInputVector(), etc).
@see APawn

**方法**:

- `AddInputVector(FVector WorldVector, bool bForce = false)`  
  Adds the given vector to the accumulated input in world space. Input vectors are usually between 0 and 1 in magnitude.
They are accumulated during a frame then applied as acceleration during the movement update.

@param WorldVector           Direction in world space to apply input
@param bForce                        If true always add the input, ignoring the result of IsMoveInputIgnored().
@see APawn::AddMovementInput()
- `FVector ConsumeInputVector()`  
  Returns the pending input vector and resets it to zero.
       * This should be used during a movement update (by the Pawn or PawnMovementComponent) to prevent accumulation of control input between frames.
       * Copies the pending input vector to the saved input vector (GetLastMovementInputVector()).
       * @return The pending input vector.
- `FVector GetLastInputVector() const`  
  Return the last input vector in world space that was processed by ConsumeInputVector(), which is usually done by the Pawn or PawnMovementComponent.
Any user that needs to know about the input that last affected movement should use this function.
@return The last input vector in world space that was processed by ConsumeInputVector().
@see AddInputVector(), ConsumeInputVector(), GetPendingInputVector()
- `APawn GetPawnOwner() const`  
  Return the Pawn that owns UpdatedComponent.
- `FVector GetPendingInputVector() const`  
  Return the pending input vector in world space. This is the most up-to-date value of the input vector, pending ConsumeMovementInputVector() which clears it.
PawnMovementComponents implementing movement usually want to use either this or ConsumeInputVector() as these functions represent the most recent state of input.
@return The pending input vector in world space.
@see AddInputVector(), ConsumeInputVector(), GetLastInputVector()
- `bool IsMoveInputIgnored() const`  
  Helper to see if move input is ignored. If there is no Pawn or UpdatedComponent, returns true, otherwise defers to the Pawn's implementation of IsMoveInputIgnored().
