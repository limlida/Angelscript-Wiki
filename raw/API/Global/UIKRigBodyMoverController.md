### UIKRigBodyMoverController


The blueprint/python API for modifying a Body Mover solver's settings in an IK Rig.
* Can adjust Solver and Goal settings.

**方法**:

- `FIKRigBodyMoverGoalSettings GetGoalSettings(FName InGoalName)`  
  Get the settings for the specified goal.
       * @param InGoalName the name of the goal to get settings for
       * @return FIKRigBodyMoverGoalSettings struct (empty if the specified goal does not belong to this solver)
- `FIKRigBodyMoverSettings GetSolverSettings()`  
  Get the current solver settings as a struct.
       * @return FIKRigBodyMoverSettings struct with the current settings used by the solver.
- `SetGoalSettings(FName InGoalName, FIKRigBodyMoverGoalSettings InSettings)`  
  Set the settings for the specified goal.
       * @param InGoalName: the name of the goal to assign the settings to.
       * @param InSettings: a custom struct type with all the settings for a goal
- `SetSolverSettings(FIKRigBodyMoverSettings InSettings)`  
  Set the solver settings. Input is a custom struct type for this solver.
       * @param InSettings a FIKRigBodyMoverSettings struct containing all the settings to apply to this solver
