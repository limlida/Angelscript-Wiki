### UInterchangeMaterialReferenceFactoryNode


Describes a reference to an existing (as in, not imported) material. Note that the material is referenced
via the UInterchangeFactoryBaseNode::CustomReferenceObject member.

The idea is that mesh / actor factory nodes can reference one of these nodes as a slot dependency, and
Interchange will assign that existing material to the corresponding slot during import
