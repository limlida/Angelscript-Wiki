# FName Literals

A lot of unreal systems use `FName` to efficiently pass around arbitrary names without having to copy and compare strings a lot. The name struct itself is just an index into a name table, and creating an `FName` from a string does a table lookup or inserts a new entry into the table.

A common pattern in C++ is to declare a global/static variable for an `FName` constant to use, so that the name table lookup only happens once at startup.

In angelscript, this pattern is simplified by using name literals. Any string that is declared as `n"NameLiteral"` will be initialized at angelscript compile time, removing the nametable lookup from runtime.

Name literals have many uses. An example of using a name literal to bind a delegate to a `UFUNCTION()` in angelscript:

```angelscript
delegate void FExampleDelegate();

class ANameLiteralActor : AActor
{
    TMap<FName, int> ValuesByName;

    void UseNameLiteral()
    {
        FName NameVariable = n"MyName";
        ValuesByName.Add(NameVariable, 1);

        FExampleDelegate Delegate;
        Delegate.BindUFunction(this, n"FunctionBoundToDelegate");
        Delegate.ExecuteIfBound();

        // Due to the name literal, no string manipulation happens
        // in calls to UseNameLiteral() during runtime.
    }

    UFUNCTION()
    void FunctionBoundToDelegate()
    {
        Print("Delegate executed");
    }
}
```
